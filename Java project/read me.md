# Movie Recommender System

This is a Java program that recommends movies to users based on their preferred genre. Users can watch recommended movies and view their watch history.

## Implementation Details

### Variables
- The program uses variables to store user information such as name and preferred genre, as well as movie information such as title, genre, and rating.

### Expressions
- Expressions are used throughout the program for various purposes, such as checking conditions and generating recommendations.

### Conditionals
- Conditionals are used to handle different scenarios, such as determining whether a user is new or returning, and whether to continue recommending movies.

### Loops
- Loops are used for iterating over movie lists, checking for duplicates, and providing a continuous user interface loop.

### Functions
- Functions are used to encapsulate behavior such as watching movies, showing watch history, and recommending movies.

### Classes
- The program defines two classes: `Movie` and `User`, to represent movies and users, respectively.

### Data Structure (Java Collection Framework)
- The program utilizes ArrayList and HashMap from the Java Collection Framework to store movies and user information.
