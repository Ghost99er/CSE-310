# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: Daniel Stockton

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (3)?

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |
|Data Analysis            |               |

|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

Write one or more programs in C++ that demonstrates some of the following:

Variables

Expressions

Conditionals

Loops

Functions

Classes

Data structure from STL (such as a vector, list, or map)

Stretch Challenges (select one):

Modify your program to read and write to a file.

Modify your program to demonstrates inheritance with virtual functions.

Modify your program to use the new and delete operators to dynamically create objects.




### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?

cppreference.com (for Standard Library documentation)
Learncpp.com (for tutorials)
Stack Overflow (for community-driven Q&A)


2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?

Basic C++ syntax and constructs (variables, expressions, conditionals, loops)
Basic functions and classes
STL data structures (vector, list, map)
Memory management (new/delete operators)
Integrate learned concepts into a larger project (e.g., Hangman game)


3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?

Basic game logic (guessing letters, displaying the word)
Enhanced background graphics
File I/O to save and load game state
Use of STL containers for storing data
Demonstration of inheritance with virtual functions

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module.

Monday to Friday: 12 PM - 9 PM at home
Saturday: 8 AM - 2 PM at home

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?

Risk: Difficulty in understanding and implementing advanced C++ concepts like inheritance and dynamic memory management.
Procrastination leading to insufficient time to complete the project.

## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|
|----------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
|  5/29    | 12:00 pm |  IM    | Implementing basic functions and classes,    4
                                Implementing Hangman game structure

|  6/3     | 12:00 pm |  IM    |  Adding file I/O operations to the game,    6
                                  Finalizing the project and documentation

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: https://github.com/Ghost99er/Hangman-C-.git

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here: https://youtu.be/_1IQWCVOk_8

3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|

|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|    X    |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   |     X   |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |      X  |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |       X |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.

Modify your program to demonstrates inheritance with virtual functions.

5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.

No

6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|        10 Hours   |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.

Sticking to a regular schedule of working daily on the project helped maintain steady progress.
Setting specific goals for each session ensured focused efforts and clear milestones.
Using a planner or calendar to track tasks and deadlines helped manage time effectively.
